# Development Log
**CS225** final project development log.

## Week 1
- Should complete core components of the project:
	- Create a file parser to read in data files
	- Design and develop the general graph structure
- Write a makefile for the project
	- A simple makefile is preferred over a complex file to reduce possibility of errors during building.
- Decided on directory structure for project.
	- We will be using separate folders for each module, then put the main file in the root of the project directory.
	- Tests employing CATCH will be stored in their own folder in the root directory.
	- Modules include the graph structure, file parser, traversal algorithms, graphics classes, and image classes from MPs. 
- Decided to follow same comment style as that employed in CS225. (Doxygen style)
- Work division:
	- File Parser: Adam and Jason
	- Beginning of graph structure: Armando and Sebastian
	- Makefile: Everyone
